            "question_text": "You mentioned you went to Waterloo and I, I gotta ask the smartest interns that I ever worked with, they came from MIT, Caltech, and Tsinghua University in China, but the best interns I ever worked with all came from Waterloo. And so I, I\u2019m curious, what is it that makes these Waterloo interns so strong?",
            "answer_text": "For me, personally, the most important thing that, uh, Waterloo got right and better than most, and I know that more schools have adopted this pattern, but it\u2019s still not well understood, is their co-op program. So what Waterloo did really well is they realized that. Yes, there is the academic portion of learning how to engineer and like what software design is all about, but then there\u2019s the hands-on and applied part and instead of modeling it as, Hey, you\u2019re gonna study for three years and then you have an optional kind of intermission style co-op, which is what, what most university operate on, right? That you could take a year off or something like that to go and work in industry. Uh, Waterloo said, you know what, we\u2019re gonna just do a rotation where every semester you study, you work, you study, you work, you study, you work. You know what that means? You don\u2019t have a break in between. You\u2019re just constantly iterating through this loop. But what it gives you is, um, at least six, six shots on goal for trying things, right? And this actually has very positive effects on many dimensions. So first of all, um. It removes the stigma of trying things, right? Because, uh, many of us, like we don\u2019t know what, what, what\u2019s gonna stick with us kind. I\u2019m coming back to my earlier point about consulting versus something else, or something else. I had so many of my peers going through university and what, where we all started with some preconceived notion of what we wanted to do. It\u2019s like, oh, I really want to go to Wall Street and work there, and they, they try one of the co-op terms there and they\u2019re like, no, I actually like that this. For whatever reason you look, I don\u2019t like the city or I don\u2019t like the industry. I didn\u2019t like the people. It like, it just didn\u2019t click for whatever reason. Right. Same thing for like medicine or others or consulting. Um, and that\u2019s really important to discover early. And the really nice thing is it\u2019s a concentrated, it\u2019s like it\u2019s a three month sprint. You get to try, right? And you have permission to try five more things, at least without the stigma of looking at your resume saying, Hey, like you, you went to a role for three months. You jumped, you went to a role for three months. You like, are you really like committed? Are you like, do I wanna hire you? It\u2019s like, no, that\u2019s my call. Right? Like, that\u2019s, that\u2019s the whole point. So you could, first of all try a bunch of things and get a kind of a good range of experiences under your belt, um, but also see the kind of, the gamut of like. Here\u2019s how a large company operates. Here\u2019s a smaller company, here\u2019s a medium, but like, which, which one resonates with me more? Right? So it\u2019s industry, it\u2019s uh, the type of work that you do. It\u2019s the type of an environment that you\u2019re in, and I think that is really helpful. On top of that, you actually get exposure to like engineer things, not learn the hypothetical and academic of like, I know how a big o notation. Expresses this particular algorithm. It\u2019s like I actually had to build a thing, right? Like, and turns out this didn\u2019t work or that particular solution worked, or we had to solve it under these constraints, and the whole big old thing was an nonissue because I was like, sorting 10 items in an array. Who cares? Right? It\u2019s like pragmatic engineering. So. I think that is key. Um, that is still the superpower of Waterloo and I wish more universities, like it\u2019s an open secret and I wish more people would copy it because it\u2019s such a lever for success for people that go through that program.",

            "question_text": "After you went through all of those iterations and all the co-op loops, understand that you started your own company, um, which became post rank. Was then acquired by Google. And I\u2019m curious the story behind you choosing to found a company Right after graduating from Waterloo.",
            "answer_text": "And as most students, um, I didn\u2019t not know what to do. Um, I wasn\u2019t ready to, to commit. Um, so my escape, uh, which is, which was a, a well drawn track for many, is I\u2019ll go to grad school. So I, I applied and then got into University of Toronto actually. And during that summer, in between, um, I had a couple of project ideas that I wanted to get off the ground. So I, I had a particular itch that I wanted to scratch, and the itch was, if you think back to, uh, how Google was founded, the key insight, if you simplify it and boil it down, that like Larry and Serge had back in 1997 is. Hey, um, we could treat the link graph of the internet effectively as a feedback loop on what is good content. So if you and I create pages and we link to each other, that\u2019s a mutual signal of both directions that there\u2019s something there, right? So disconnected pages are not worth much, but in effect, it\u2019s kind of a social currency. Links are a social currency right now, fast forward to 20 10, 20 11, when I\u2019m sitting there, the web two revolution. Has already happened or like well underway. You now all of a sudden have dynamic content on the web. Not static links. Not static webpages, but we have comments on blogs, right? Blogs became a thing, comments became a common thing. So my observation was, Hey, if a conversation is happening on Reddit about an interview that Ryan has recorded, like that means there\u2019s something there. I don\u2019t, I can\u2019t qualitatively say whether it\u2019s good or bad, I just know that people are talking about it and that a signal. So what if. You built a system that went out and aggregated all of these interactions. Then built a better version of PageRank effectively, right. Links becomes one input, but you know, thumbs up, a number of conversations, a number of likes, and all of these things become additional inputs. And that was post, post rank, right? It\u2019s, it\u2019s kind of embedded in the name. It\u2019s a, it\u2019s a, was an algorithm for ranking posts based on social engage. Kind of a child of the web two oh era. Still remember the day. It was like July 8th when I released it. And then I did sleep for three days because the servers were melting down, not strictly because it was like such huge demand, although there was, it was also because my code was terrible. So it was kinda like brute force and just throw more servers at the problem and then eventually, uh, you know, optimize it out over the next couple of weeks to, to get it back to a measurable set. So that becomes kind of this nucleus of, hey, there\u2019s a. There\u2019s a feature there, right? And it got, um, it got good publicity, uh, which then turned into conversation, Hey, is there a product here? So I remember those juncture points, uh, somewhere late in May where kinda in the middle of all these conversations with investors, um, kind unanticipated fork in the path, right? And I\u2019m thinking, what, what do I do? Like I\u2019m uncertain. Are we gonna be able to close around? Can I do this? Because in a couple of weeks I\u2019m supposed to start my grad, my grad work. And I\u2019m looking at that syllabus. I\u2019m like, what are the courses I\u2019m most interested in? And I go through the list and it was like the, the ones that immediately stood out to me about like entrepreneurship and like how to do a company. I\u2019m like, wait a second. So I could go and learn about the stuff academically and read books or I can, like, I\u2019m literally having the conversations right now with investors like I, or I could just like. Going, like, I, I can read those books on my own time and I could, couldn\u2019t, I can go and try it. Which, uh, led me to reaching out to my advisor and basically asking, Hey, yeah, can I take a, a year time out? You know, I was planning to do this this year, but how about I start next year? And he handed hard and said, okay, I understand. And, you know, come back to me in six months. Um, to close that story, we did end up closing the round and that became, post the post rank the company. And, uh, I never did get to finish my, uh, so-called graduate degree.",

Hush, hush. Um, what does that kind of conversation look like? Like when they reach out for an acquisition and maybe you can tell that story.",
            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a lot less stressful than you make it sound to be. I remember we were actually. Well, we were building the product that I was describing and, uh, we were presenting at one of the conferences in the Bay Area and, you know, we got off stage and, uh, Phil Muy, who was one who was the, uh, kind of lead PM on Google Analytics kind walked up to us and like, Hey, this, this is cool. Uh, do you wanna have a chat? And I remember taking a train from San Francisco to Mountain Mul later that day, sitting in the conference room and him basically interrogating us about what is it that you build? And then, um, ending the conversation with, Hey, maybe we should do something together. It\u2019s like, okay, well, tell me more. Right? Um, that, that\u2019s a, that\u2019s a blank check for the follow up conversation. Um, so it, it was, it was very friendly. There\u2019s, there\u2019s nothing, uh, kind of, uh, more to it than that. And then, uh, what we learned, uh, after is this is right. In the time span when Google and Facebook were, uh, like at war in terms of drawing the battle lines for social, uh, this is when Google woke up to the fact that Facebook is on a runaway trajectory and, um, all hands on deck. Google needed, this is when Google starts working on Google Plus, uh, which of course has since been sunset. Uh, but it became this catalyze catalyzer with the Google for. Hey, we, we need an answer. And they were looking for all the help that they could get and all the experience that they could acquire to speed run this whole thing. Um, and we became that catalyst for Google Analytics because what they saw in us is like, they, frankly, they did not care for the uh, and. PR product that we were building. What they cared about was, uh, the experience and some of the infrastructure that we we\u2019ve accumulated that we could bring in to fast run and fast track this whole thing to say, Hey, if I\u2019m using Google Analytics, I can get really good insights on how my social engagement is going, and I can figure out how Google Plus is helping me and all the rest. Um, so that became the kind of the, the mutual point of win-win situation, um, that led us, uh, joining forces with Google Analytics.",

Where you bring in the whole team and, and you kind of do a, a wholesale evaluation. But otherwise, um, everyone on our team went through the panel. Through the full panel, uh, myself included. Uh, so that, that was, that was the bar. And really the exercise for them was to vet the quality of the team and then to figure out where all the engineers stack up.",

            "answer_text": "It, it depends on the company that, that, you know, and then the deal of, of course. So there, there\u2019s both polar to it exactly as you said, right? There\u2019s the, like, there\u2019s the ip, there\u2019s the customers, uh, there\u2019s the people and you can treat those as kind of distinct conversations, right? So as far as negotiations concerned, um, are you acquiring the product? What are you gonna do with the customers, right? Um, is there IP there? Are you gonna use the technology? Um, many, like, there\u2019s the Acquihire acquisition where you\u2019re effectively acquiring the team. You\u2019re saying, cool thing you built, but that\u2019s not the thing I need you to be building. Let\u2019s just put that on the shelf and let\u2019s just focus on like rebuilding the thing. Um, in our infrastructure, um, poster was closer to that. It was not a full kind of acquihire because they brought in and they, they used the ip, but for all intents and purposes, the thing that we built ourselves, we had to rebuild from scratch within the Google analytics. Because you\u2019re just operating at a completely different order of magnitude. Right. And it was an amazing trial by fire, if anything, for our engineering team because we went from managing tens of thousands of analytics accounts. And granted, yes, we were crawling the web at a fairly large scale to operating in a service that was literally executing on half more than half the internet. So like to, to make a modification to a data pipeline. I remember the conversations fondly, uh, like sitting with our SRE team and they\u2019re like, okay, well you\u2019re gonna add this bit field right here. That\u2019s gonna be this number of exabytes of data. I\u2019m like, oh my gosh. Okay, let me think about this more carefully, right? Because before that was not even a, a conversation point for me and, and my team. So. Um, a lot of it was about the talent and bring, making, ensuring that they\u2019re bringing in the right folks with the right experience and, um, that they\u2019re capable of kind of hitting the ground running and, and working with, with the rest of the Google Analytics team.",

            "question_text": "So I want to get into your career at Google and it sounds like you were placed initially in Google Analytics. I\u2019m curious what the leveling was and the role. Were you a manager? \u2018cause you mentioned your, you brought your team with you.",
            "answer_text": "So I was founder and CTO of post rank and I joined as an engineering manager. Um, \u2018cause effectively that\u2019s what my, my role was, um, at Google and I was very invested in making sure that we build the right thing the right way. And kind of manifest the vision of why we started this damn company to begin with. Because I strongly believed in like, I want to help publishers understand that was still like me scratching my own itch of like, I\u2019m gonna make Google Analytics solve my problem, damnit. Um, and um, I think we, we succeeded, um, at that, it took us about a year to effectively rebuild our stack and the team was on a good trajectory. And, and that\u2019s where I. Uh, kind of took a step back and looked around for, Hey, what\u2019s the next adventure? Um, I was in a really good direction, uh, within Google Analytics, and I, I remember, um, a conversation with one of our VPs at the time where, uh, you know, we were having one of these career sit downs and you\u2019re like, look, um, you have all the things you need, you\u2019re on track for director. You know, here are the things. That I, I could see, I could see you take on and all the rest, and I\u2019m like, huh, that sounds all exciting. And like, and I\u2019m very honored that like, you think I\u2019m capable of doing this work, but at the same time, um, I couldn\u2019t not let my curiosity get the better of me. Like Google is such an amazing technical playground that even though that first year was a pressure cooker of like, I need to get this thing shipped. I\u2019m gonna work my, my butt off to get it working. I also was spending every free moment of time just like diving deep into various design documents and wikis. Uh, Google is an open culture, which is the thing that I loved about Google, and I could approach anyone at everyone about. Um, any piece of infrastructure, any product, and I leveraged that. Um, and I learned a lot because, you know, I remember building post rank and reading papers that were published about Big Table this and Hadoop that, and like trying to figure out how to replicate some of the magic that Google had. And then I\u2019m reading the internal design documents and I\u2019m like, oh my God, this is three generations ahead of this paper that I was reading. This is amazing. Like, like I, I wish the world knew about this, right? And then I would, half the time I would talk to the engineers. I\u2019m like, how come. We never published a follow up on this thing. They\u2019re like, we\u2019re too busy. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s a trade secret. We\u2019re literally too damn busy. Like, you know, if you find us the time. And I was like, huh. Well that\u2019s interesting. Like wouldn\u2019t it benefit the entire world, the entire, like internet if we did more of this? Um, which led me down some interesting conversations. And I discovered this group within Google, which was called Make the Web Fast, which was basically a sunk course project started by, uh, Sergey. Um, around, well, how can we make the internet fast? Uh, and it\u2019s a very kind of self-referential, self-motivating thing. Um, that there\u2019s very direct evidence that the faster the internet is, the faster users browse the web, browse the web, the more they use Google. So it\u2019s a mutually beneficial relationship, right? So within that group, we had all kinds of fun products. We literally built radio towers trying to figure out how to build more effective, uh, cellular networks, uh, you know, dog trenches built, built towers. Uh, we worked on T-C-P-I-P and trying to figure out how to reduce congestion. Uh, we worked at optimizing proxies for, hey, turns out that most humans write terrible websites. Could we just like optimize it out on, kind of dynamically as a web server plugin to. Hold on a second. When we say make the intranet fast, what does that even mean? Like, we know it when we see it and when we feel it, but if you had to put a number on it, how do you express that? Right. So if you, if you walk the, the full dynamic range of those questions you like, it\u2019s, it\u2019s an just absolutely amazing laboratory of like, experiments to run. And I was really fascinated about about that. And I remember at that, at that point in time, I, I, I realized that I had. I had an opportunity to cash in some chips and I could say, look, um, I, I see a path towards kind of career growth as a director in this and that, and that would be a great achievement. On the other hand, I could take a step back. I could take this lateral step and go and work as an IC in this field, I\u2019m actually not quite even sure how I\u2019m gonna contribute. I just know that this is a really cool area that I\u2019m passionate about and I\u2019ll hopefully probably find something useful that I can do there. Um, but that would definitely take me off the career track. Right? I remember that conversation. It was like, well, you know, if, uh, I see bar at Google is actually really high, so if anything you\u2019re gonna be down leveled, likely, um, and you\u2019re gonna reset your track. I was like, okay. I think that\u2019s a trade worth having because I get to control my time. I get to work with people I look up to, and I get to work in a particular, on a domain that I think is just absolutely fascinating. So I made that pivot and in retrospect it was an amazing right decision for me because, um, it allowed me to kind of flex my curiosity and technical muscle in a completely different direction.",

And the observation is, um. I think it was a tour of duty, uh, when I\u2019m, when I\u2019m doing management. Um, to be a really effective like principal plus engineer, you need to have very good dynamic range technically, right? And you can, you can work well at the low level of the stack. You can also zoom out and look at the business requirements currently deeply at understand what\u2019s actually necessary. Where can you relax constraints, uh, where can, where you need to hold, uh, hold the line and all the rest, and. Once you get attached to certain projects, like some projects you can execute and you call it done, you\u2019re like a great, I solved that problem, right? But many problems that are handed to you, they, they become, they come as nebulous statements that then evolve into, ha this is actually like a team\u2019s worth of effort. Like, now that we\u2019ve understood the shape of this problem, and, uh, what often happens is you, you kind of, you see this pattern of, um, some. Individual doing the trailblazing work path, finding where, where we need to climb, and then they find themselves, okay, now I need to recruit a team of people to help me actually build a thing. Like I know how to get to top of that hill with a machete, but now I need to build a highway. Right? And to build a highway, I need a team. Okay, well lemme go find a team. Before you know it, you\u2019re kind of, you, you\u2019re, you\u2019re tl. Right, and you\u2019re exercising yourself power to help direct people and all the rest. It\u2019s not a far stretch to switch to a manager, right? Because it\u2019s like, well now you\u2019re doing performance management as well, plus a few other tricks. But oftentimes you\u2019ll find kind of yourself, um, managing or being responsible for the direction of a broader team. Before you know it, like, I think it\u2019s a natural transition to say, well, okay, fine, I\u2019m gonna like manage this domain. I\u2019m gonna manage this as a product team. I\u2019m gonna manage this, uh, like the growth of the individuals and the rest. And that\u2019s completely fine. That\u2019s what happened to me with, uh, developer relations. Um, when you think back to the kinda the set of problems that I, that I shared with you, um, I ended up gravitating towards the question of how do you measure performance? And I found myself doing a lot of web standards work. I got engaged with W3C and ITF and, and trying to figure out, hey, what kind of metrics can we define in browsers such that we all have a common ground truth for how to measure performance? And that was great. Uh, did a lot of that and that was my kind of IC contributor role. Um, then you get those metrics into browser and then the problem becomes great. Uh, how do I get community or ecosystem adoption in this thing? Well, I need to go tell people and I need to convince them to adopt it, right? Uh, and integrate it well, now I need to go talk to all of the analytics vendors. Uh, let me go talk to all the open source projects, right? That problem does not scale with one human. Like you really need help of other humans. This is where the go to market and the kind of developer relations part came in, and I quickly realized that like. It would be really helpful to have a team of people that can focus on this thing. And this is the thing we deeply care about. We want to accelerate the adoption of these things. It\u2019s kind of my, my as, um, model based on prior experience was, look, if we just leave this ecosystem be as it is in three to five years time, we will probably see the adoption that we want. But I\u2019m not happy with three to five years. Like my question is, how can I compress it into one to two years? Ideally one year or less. Right? And for that to happen, we need to inject, we need to inject energy into the system. The energy is a team of people. Great, fine. Let me switch to the my manager role. I\u2019m gonna go recruit people and I\u2019m gonna like put my organizer hat on and we\u2019re gonna go and execute this problem.",

Like you, you see some problem. Maybe em is the best way to solve that problem. Maybe IC is, but it\u2019s really all about the problem.",
            "answer_text": "Exactly. And it\u2019s kind of like your relationship and your commitment to the problem. Right? Because not every problem has to become your mission. Um, I am often engaged in projects where I am participating. I\u2019m actively contributing. And then I say, look guys, you\u2019re. You\u2019re well on the way, like you have the right vector, go execute. You have everything you need, like you don\u2019t need me here. And in fact, that\u2019s my kind of measure of success as a, as a principal engineer oftentimes, right? I don\u2019t, if the team is dependent on me. Pro that means that I\u2019m probably doing something wrong because my job is to uplevel the team and make sure that they can deliver this thing self sufficiently. So if, you know the, uh, the Homer Simpson meme where he like disappears into the bushes? Yeah, right. Like, it\u2019s like kinda like that. Like if I can pull that off successfully on a project and the team continues executing in the right direction with a good velocity, and like, that\u2019s success for me. Oftentimes. Now, occasionally I stumble into a problem where I\u2019m like, either I\u2019m like, just. It\u2019s in my bones and I feel like I need to be, like, I want to own that problem and see it to this logical conclusion. Um, or I have some unique position or leverage in it where like, yes, I\u2019m the right person to take on the broader responsibility and kind of execution of the team to see it through completion. And it\u2019s a judgment call for which, you know, when you pull that off and when you say, okay, this is gonna be my tour of duty, like my job is over the next, I know that I\u2019m committing for the next two years or something. To like really run this thing, own this ship. And that\u2019s my responsibility. And you know what? At the end of it, I\u2019m gonna do the same thing I did before. I\u2019m gonna like, my success, I, I, I need a succession plan. And my succession plan is either we solve the problem when it\u2019s done, or I\u2019ve set out on trajectory where I can successfully pull back and focus on the next thing. And to focus on the next thing. I\u2019m gonna become an IC again and go find the next thing to solve.",

            "question_text": "I know later the story continues with you went to Shopify. You became an IC and you went from a principal engineer to a distinguished engineer. I\u2019m curious, what is the tour of duty there that got you promoted?",
            "answer_text": "One of the, I think, underappreciated or misunderstood aspects of being a principal engineer is when people ask what, what does, what do you do? Like, you know, give me, give me a job description because I wanna become a principal engineer. Like, what are the boxes I need to tick? And the answer is actually embedded in the question. People that have to ask that question by definition are not principal engineers, right? Because the problems become ambiguous enough at that level where you kind of have to figure it out yourself. Like my expectation for, I, I mentor a lot of, uh, principal engineers that come into Shopify. Uh, my expectation for someone coming in that level is look, um, you basically, to use an analogy here, you\u2019re gonna be dropped parachuted into foreign terrain. You\u2019re in a recon, reconnaissance mission, and within the first seven days, you should figure out to lay the land and figure out where the problems are. Build alliances with your directors, VPs, whoever it needs to be, figure out what their problems are, and then kind of understand the situation and figure out where you can apply your particular skillset to help. I don\u2019t have a prescription for you, like it, it is your agency. It is your problem to figure this out. And that requires a particular kind of skillset and a toolkit that you have to develop to figure that out because there\u2019s a lot of ambiguity in that. Um, going to a level above that, uh, as distinguished engineer, it\u2019s even more amorphous in many ways. There isn\u2019t any shared definition. Right. But I, the way I think about it is. Proof of the dynamic range of the problems that you can solve. So, and then dynamic range kind of goes in a couple of different directions. One is technically, uh, so are you able to, have you shown a repeatable record of being able to operate kind of. All layers of the stack. If you\u2019re engaged with a team, are you able to kind of go all the way down to the bare metal and understand what are the constraints? What are the problems kind of from ground truth, reconstruct the problem at the same time? Are you able to operate with the business requirements, you know, with your VP and product counterparts? So actually understand what\u2019s in their head. How it manifests in code and translate that into actionable change and like deliver the right product. That\u2019s the technical aspect of it. Um, but then there\u2019s also the, uh, the execution model, uh, kind of in the middle where you have to be able to flex. Uh, there are different types of projects that you get parachuted into. Some projects are, uh. Working at the frontier of knowledge or product space where there\u2019s like just fog of war. You don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know, and you have to be working kind of the less startup mode of, look, we\u2019re gonna fire, we\u2019re gonna see where it lands, then we\u2019re gonna aim and we\u2019re gonna fire again, and we\u2019re gonna do that really rapidly, really fast as quickly as we can, so we can figure out where the hell we are, and then we\u2019ll figure out what we\u2019re gonna build. Right? That requires a particular skillset. On the other hand, you can be parachuted into. Kinda a, a slower moving pace, A pace layer of the company where it\u2019s like, okay guys, we have this, uh, platform API problem. You know, we have a, just use them like a random example, right? Um, and. It\u2019s really important that we think through how we design this API, because it\u2019ll have second and third order repercussions, like years down the road for our partner ecosystem and all the rest. So we need to engage our slow thinking brain to really understand how this change at this layer will manifest its way through all the others. Right? And that\u2019s a very different mode of engagement. That\u2019s like, that\u2019s much more, in a way, academic, but you also need to be able to take all of that divergent thinking and converge the problem to like, here, here\u2019s the actual recommendation. Right. So it really becomes the demonstration of your toolkit of being able to execute across all of those domains. Because when you talk to, like, the expectation for a distinguished engineer is kind of similar to a vp, like it, it is a VP equivalent role, right? Like, write me a description for a vp. Well, the job of of a VP is to solve every problem that lands on their plate, right? It\u2019s like, and by definition, all the easy problems have been solved. Before, like at layers below them, so they only get the heart problems with incomplete information or imperfect decisions. So, uh, show me the volume and show me the versatility of your toolkit. That gives me confidence that I could parachute you into, like, I can give you this weird shaped problem next. And with reasonable success, you\u2019ll be able to navigate yourself out of it. Uh, one thing that I, I share often with, uh, folks that I coach and work with is I, I, I have this belief that a better way, a more resilient way to build your career is to optimize for being the only person as opposed to the best person. So what does that actually mean? There, there are two different paths that you could take. You could say, look. I\u2019m gonna pick a particular domain and I\u2019m gonna be the best person that will know the most about a particular thing. So I\u2019m gonna like, take security as an example, right? I\u2019m gonna learn everything there is to know, and that\u2019s gonna be my life, life calling. And that\u2019s great, but there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with that. Um, you, you can optimize for that. My personal philosophy is, um, that is one way to success, but it is not the most resilient way to success, uh, because what if you pick the wrong field? What if the world changes under you, what if, um, your particular company does not need that particular skill set? B, the only to me is, is about building a talent stack or a portfolio of skills that you can juggle and be effective. And I think this is actually, um, reflects back in the dynamic range conversation that we were just having. Right. Were you able to say, look. And maybe this is actually me justifying my own career track because when I look back on my career, I could say like, look, I was a mediocre designer. I was a mediocre um, salesperson. I was okay at support, but like, come on, like that. That\u2019s not my life calling either. But you know what? I did really well. I all of those things into a unique toolkit that other people could not do. Like, I could look at a problem and I could say, yeah, I could link together a website. I know Photoshop well enough. I know how to host it and I know how to secure it, and I can stand all that up for you in, you know, in the next two days. You don\u2019t have to hire a team for that. And I have, I have the dynamic range to do that. Now, if it turns out that, um, we now hire the graphic designer, that\u2019s excellent, but great. I\u2019m just gonna take that particular skill set out of Mike Quiver, hand it over to them, and I\u2019m gonna focus on the other things. Right. And I think generally, uh, you can acquire very high competence, like 80, 90%, uh, competence very quickly in a domain. You can get to 80% in a matter of days to weeks. And especially now with the tools that we have access to with LLMs and all the rest, like the ability to acquire context is, uh, just amazing. You can spend the next year to get yourself to 90%. And now if you optimize for that, you have resilience because. I\u2019m able to converse with our marketing team because, you know what? I took the time, like I, I literally remember going on Amazon and I bought 15 books on marketing and I spent a week nothing but reading marketing books so I could understand the lexicon, the jargon, and, and speak the right words when I talked to marketing teams. I\u2019m also adept enough at, uh, working with our PR teams because, like I\u2019ve written a lot, right? And I\u2019ve practiced that muscle. I\u2019m also an engineer, so I now I\u2019m able to bridge. So oftentimes when I find myself in conversations at Shopify or elsewhere, I am the translator between all of these different parts of the company and organs of the body where I\u2019m able to kind of synthesize that information and bring it together. And that gives me a lot of versatility, right? It doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m the smartest person in, in the room. Uh, oftentimes it\u2019s far from the, uh, uh, from the truth. I\u2019m often the most senior person, but rarely am I the most knowledgeable, and that\u2019s actually very important because part of my skillset is to figure out who are the most knowledgeable people and figure out how to leverage them in the most effective way. Right. My contribution is, I understand kind of the fundamentals. Of the platform and what you can do with, um, our APIs or our platform. I understand the business requirements. There\u2019s a very messy middle, in the middle of how you actually implement the solution with a number of variants, that\u2019s not my responsibility. My responsibility is to help the people that know the most about that messy middle navigate through that decision space, and I have a toolkit to help them facilitate that. But it\u2019s not, it doesn\u2019t mean that, you know, the most senior person in the room knows all the answers, which I think is a mistake that a lot of engineers make when they think about principal engineers. Like, oh, if you\u2019re a principal, you know everything. There\u2019s to know about the web platform. It\u2019s like, well, not really, right? Like what I\u2019ve learned is a lot of pattern matching. I\u2019ve learned how to find answers, I know where to find answers, and I know how to navigate myself out of tricky situations. But it doesn\u2019t mean that I know every API and every cork. Now some people do because that\u2019s what they make their life calling and that\u2019s, I think that that\u2019s perfectly fine. But as a general strategy, I think it\u2019s not as resilient. Got an anti-fragile career is where you have a set of these capabilities where you can just swap out and then you give a moment and and say, okay, well I guess I\u2019m solving a go-to market problem right now, so let me pull out my other quiver of capabilities.",

So when you say don\u2019t be the best, be the only, you\u2019re saying that generalists have an advantage because they can put together a bunch of skill sets, get most of the way there, and be the only because the intersection of all the skill sets is more special and more resilient because you have such a wide toolbox. Is that right?",
            "answer_text": "Yeah, this is, this is literally probability math, right? It\u2019s like how many people, if you multiply out the probabilities of how many people know this particular, have this particular skill set, like you know enough about databases, you know, enough about graphics, you know about, you know enough about all these other components, who is the person that is the only person that has sufficient. Domain expertise and connective tissue to solve this problem. Right? So the on being the only is about having a wide range of tools that you can reach into and say, Hey, I can combine them in any particular way, which is what makes you versatile and makes you effective in these kinda ambiguous situations where you can, based on the situation, adapt how you work, right? Because I can shove gears and say, look, I\u2019ve, I\u2019ve been a manager before. I understand what it means to do performance management. I understand how to coach people, um, so I can.

It doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m exercising that skill all the time, but I\u2019m able to be parachuted into a situation where I can act as that temporarily, and that\u2019s turned out to be incredibly helpful.",

So I would absolutely encourage, um, if you\u2019re on IC track and you\u2019ve never tried management, like def, like being a TL is a great learning wheels. Um, you should definitely try if it, if it suits you to do management as well, but don\u2019t assume that it\u2019s a one-way path. You can go back and forth and there isn\u2019t a stigma. I think historically there has been in some organizations, because also we\u2019ve kind of painted this picture of, hey, the path to success is you grow to be a manager. But that\u2019s not like when I talk to a lot of managers in like high roles directors and all the rest, you know, after you sit at a bar and, and, and have a couple of drinks, they\u2019re like, you and your flight back and when was, when were you happiest in your career? They say. Huh. You know, it was a couple years back before I became an ex because I had, like, I was really confident at that thing, and I was loving it, but I was told that in order for me to like grow, quote unquote, I needed to take on this other thing. It\u2019s like, well, huh, well that\u2019s, that\u2019s an interesting reflection. Right. And at the same time, they will reflect and say, but I\u2019ve also learned a lot in this new role. I appreciate what it means to run a team. The complexity, the interpersonal dynamics, the performance management, and all the rest. And that\u2019s an amazing tool to have in your toolkit. Great. Now, um, let\u2019s set up our organizations in a way where that is okay for people to transit between those roles. Uh, you\u2019re not penalized, and let\u2019s not as an industry position as some sort of like demotion, right? Because oftentimes it\u2019s like, oh, you\u2019re a manager. You became an ic.

            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t let the pressure of your success stop you from trying. Um, let, let me unpack that a little bit. Uh. I reflected on this like as, as a writer, as a blogger. I remember like when I look back, um, and I wonder if you can, like, if you can relate to this, when I look back on my early writing, I read it. Now I\u2019m like, oh my God, that is terrible. What was it? Like, how could I have published that? That is just flat out embarrassing. I hope nobody finds this right. Or, uh, frankly, if I go on GitHub and look at my own projects, like it is embarrassing code. But you know what? It was the limit of my ability at the time when I did it, and I\u2019m so glad that I did it right because it was those milestones, like putting that work out there that gave me the right feedback, gave me the right encouragement that then led me to improve. But the challenge that you run into is as you level up and as you get an like an audience and an expectation, it\u2019s like, well, you know, Ryan\u2019s interviews are really good. So in the next one, like I, I expect it to be like an out of the park better than ever. So you keep setting a higher and higher bar where you start to filter like, you know, here\u2019s the thing I would\u2019ve published before, but uh, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s up to my standard now. Like, is it really interesting? Do I have a unique take on it? Whereas before it was like, I don\u2019t care. Like just a thought. Here you go. Keep publishing. Like, I struggled with this all the time. Like, keep putting stuff out there because don\u2019t let that expectation become a gate and filter.

That, that feeling of that downgrade is, is tough for a lot of people.",
            "answer_text": "Yeah. That\u2019s where setting the right expectations with yourself and others is also very important, right. The, the way you show up to these conversations makes all the difference, right? Because I don\u2019t show up as, Hey, I know all the answers. Rather, I show up as, Hey guys, I\u2019m here to help. I\u2019m just, I\u2019m like, really curious and I started asking why? Like, what? What are the fundamentals? Help me understand this. The way you ask questions becomes very important. Because it\u2019s very easy to come across as trying to question all the things as opposed to being curious, right? Like, there, there\u2019s a subtle difference between them. Um, am I trying to attack your work or am I just trying to construct a model and just setting clear expectations of that? Um, oftentimes when I begin these conversations, I\u2019m just very open about, guys, I don\u2019t know what you, what you know. Right. And I need to very rapidly build my mental model of this space. So I\u2019m gonna ask a lot of dumb questions like, excuse me upfront. I also have my expertise and I also know some other things that you don\u2019t. Um, so help me navigate through this. And it becomes a collaborative of exercise, right? Because I can. Uh, clear roadblocks and do things that they can\u2019t, but they can bring all of the knowledge. And this becomes the symbiotic relationship of that goes back to how do I leverage the expertise of people in the room as opposed to trying to question their work. And that takes a lot of that stigma out of that new environment, uh, in work. But I think there\u2019s, uh, an even higher filter from when you\u2019re like broadcasting because there\u2019s an expectation and an aura of like what. What you\u2019re expected to be saying.

            "answer_text": "The first thing that comes to mind, and this is, uh, this is not a book, but an author. So Ken Robinson, uh, he has a series of books, um, on like finding your Element Creative Schools and the rest, uh, if nothing else, uh, go on YouTube and search for Ken Robinson and watch his TED Talks. Uh, it is I think 20 minutes of your time. That is gonna be the highest ROI. If not today, this week, may, maybe this year. Uh, he, he\u2019s been an inspiration to me and it\u2019s, I think his messages needs to be continued. Uh, unfortunately he passed away. But a key of it is we need to rethink how we think about education. And that actually kind of circles back to the conversation, but we\u2019re having, but Waterloo, his message is, stop. We need to rethink our education system from a factory line model where we like put people by age into a certain bin and teach them specific skills like we, we all. Spike in different ways at different points in our life, right? Like let\u2019s have an environment where people can choose their own adventure. Now that how do you execute that turns out to be really hard. And he dedicated his life to trying to figure that out. Like how do you reform the educational system? But I think his philosophy is very much kind of in line and probably informed a lot of my thinking for, hey, it is about creativity. You should mix things up. You should combine skills. Let\u2019s build a system that actually allows us to like, help kids learn these behaviors better as opposed to pigeonholing themselves into like, well, no, you\u2019re in grade five. In grade five, you\u2019re only supposed to learn this thing. Thank you very much. And, uh, like, please don\u2019t touch advanced math until you like, until you in grade six. It\u2019s like, well that\u2019s, that\u2019s nonsense, right? Like for some kids, they can go all the way to grade eight math when they\u2019re in grade five. Just use one example.",

            "answer_text": "I would come back to \u201cdon\u2019t be the best, be the only\u201d. Um, I, I think early in my career had a lot of fear of, Hey, I\u2019m, I\u2019m a mediocre at a lot of things. Like I, I see my friends, I would look up to my friends who are really good at design. Like, oh, I wish I could do that. Right. Or look to my other friends who were just better engineers. Like, I wish I could do that, could do that. But the thing that I had was ability to negotiate across all those themes. And that\u2019s uncomfortable because I wasn\u2019t sure if that would pan out. And it turns out that it did. Um, and then the other thing is, uh, ex exactly as we were just discussed, don\u2019t, like, don\u2019t, don\u2019t filter or be, be, be braver about this stuff. Um. It\u2019s, it\u2019s kind of ironic that later in my career, I part of like my nine to five effectively became public speaking. Going through high school. I was deathly afraid of public speaking. I would run away from class to avoid it, right? Like I said, I, I vividly remember those stories and then it dawned on me later when I was doing post rank that, Hey, how, why is it that I was. Even through university, like I had cold sweats standing out in front of a class trying to explain the thing. Uh, but I was totally adept and fine when I was pitching, uh, my product to, uh, an audience. And the difference is, in one hand, I, I was trying to describe a thing that, you know, I didn\u2019t have any particular investment in. It was a test of my knowledge. Versus, here\u2019s the thing I\u2019m passionate about and I want to like enact change in the ecosystem to move it to some new direction. So that turned out to make all the difference for me. And uh, maybe that\u2019s the key thing. Like if you told me, uh, early in my college career that my future holds public speaking, I would, I don\u2019t know what I would do. I would say that you\u2019re crazy.",
